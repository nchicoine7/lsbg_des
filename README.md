# Weak Gravitational Lensing of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in DES Y3

Includes data files from weak lensing measurements and lens catalogs, NFW profile codes to model the measurements (derived from Profiley) `<https://profiley.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`, and stellar mass estimation codes.

Note: The 2MPZ catalog ('2MPZ.fits'), footprint for the randoms sample ('y3a2_footprint_grizY_any.fits'), and the source catalog ('2pt_NG_final_2ptunblind_02_24_21_wnz_redmagic_covupdate.fits') are too large to be uploaded to github. As such, they are availble upon request.
